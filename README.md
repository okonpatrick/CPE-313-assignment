# CPE-313-assignment
Year 3 (University) Computational technique  assignment
Assignment
In CPE 313 class, we have people who are specialists in different fields as follows:
Blockchain_tech = {Akpan, Victor, Chris, Greg}
Data_analysis = {Chris, Uwem, Fred}
Robotics = {chris, Fred, Kings, Victor}
Mobile_app = {Fred, Akpan, Victor, Unyime}
We intend to choose people for three projects as follows:
a)	Project A should consist of people who are Roboticists but neither a Data Analyst nor a blockchain expert.
b)	Project B should include all data analysts who are also good in mobile app development.
c)	Project C should contain everyone who is skilled in Blockchain and/or Mobile app development but not a roboticist.
Use set operations in Python to explore this.
